# Marcin Balejko - Junior Developer looking for new challenges

## Contact: marcinbalejko@gmail.com or (+48)515522649

I am a disciplined, focused and hardworking individual with a great passion for programming. I became interested in technology and application development during my studies in China where I studied Mandarin Chinese. I am always willing to face any challenges with determination and commitment. In my work I pay great attention to details and always try to analyse new concepts until I get to their core. I love to learn new things and acquire skills that can be useful in various projects that I'm engaged with.

While sudying in China, my interest in programming was increasing rapidly, and I devoted myself into studying this subject with a great enthusiasm. By using various free resources available on the internet, as well as bootcamp teaching materials I have made a great progress in my code writing and application designing skills.
Right after obtaining master's degree, I decided to keep working on my programming portfolio and pursue a career of a developer.

As someone who majored in linguistics, I often like to view programming as a way of learning a new, fascinating language full of complex syntax that can be used to create amazing works, and also to exchange new ideas and concepts with others. During my studies in Asia, I found it fascinating how important and omnipresent are the mobile applications and web-based technology in modern societies. Creating new web devices that help people in their day-to-day life is an amazing and fulfilling thing to do. Web development with its endless innovations pushes the world towards great changes and future. That being said, I would love to be one who contributes to that future.

## Skills

**Problem solving**

Being a self taught developer, I needed to face hundreds of problems and difficult tasks without anyone's help. However, I know very well how to use various information sources available on the internet, and quickly find  solutions for all the issues. With tools such as tutorials, books, google and programming forums there is no problem for me that I would not be able to solve.

**Attention to details**

Coding requires a great amount of attention in order to prevent the whole program from failing. I am certainly a person who does not neglect small details in the process of project development. I always prioritize testing and debugging my applications before submitting the final version, and I am able to spot mistakes and inaccuracies in my projects quickly.
Moreover, attention to details made me keep my code dry and avoid repetition that could later lead to errors and general confusion.

**Patience**

Patience is definitely one of my strong points. Patience by the description is the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, problems, or suffering without becoming annoyed or anxious. I have learned patience while working on my application projects. In addition, having studied Mandarin Chinese as my major taught me that self discipline, commitment, practice and not getting anxious for immediate results are the key factors for success and quality.
